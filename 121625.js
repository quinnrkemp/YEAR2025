  // CHALLENGE NAME-  Thinkful - Number Drills: Blue and red marbles

    // DESCRIPTION:

// You and a friend have decided to play a game to drill your statistical 
// intuitions. The game works like this:

// You have a bunch of red and blue marbles. To start the game you grab a 
// handful of marbles of each color and put 
// them into the bag, keeping track of how many of each color go in. You 
// take turns reaching into the bag, guessing a color, and then pulling 
// one marble out. You get a point if you guessed correctly. The trick 
// is you only have three seconds to make your guess, so you have to think 
// quickly.

// You've decided to write a function, guessBlue() to help automatically 
// calculate whether you should guess "blue" or "red". The function should 
// take four arguments:

// the number of blue marbles you put in the bag to start
// the number of red marbles you put in the bag to start
// the number of blue marbles pulled out so far (always lower than the 
//     starting number of blue marbles)
// the number of red marbles pulled out so far (always lower than the 
//     starting number of red marbles)
// guessBlue() should return the probability of drawing a blue marble, 
// expressed as a float. For example, guessBlue(5, 5, 2, 3) should return 0.6.

//     // ***STARTER CODE***

//  function guessBlue(blueStart, redStart, bluePulled, redPulled) {
//   // Your code here.
//     return 0.0;
// }   

//     //   ******TEST CASES*****
    
// describe("tests", function(){
//     const { assert } = require('chai');
//     const DELTA = 1e-5;

//     it("Basic tests", function(){
//       assert.approximately(guessBlue(5, 5, 2, 3), 0.6, DELTA);
//       assert.approximately(guessBlue(5, 7, 4, 3), 0.2, DELTA);
//       assert.approximately(guessBlue(12, 18, 4, 6), 0.4, DELTA);
//     });
// });

    // ******MY ANSWER********

function guessBlue(bs, rs, bp, rp) {
  let tot1=bs+rs
  let tot2=tot1-(bp+rp)
  return (bs-bp)/tot2
  // Your code here.
