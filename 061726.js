    // CHALLENGE NAME-  Online RPG: player to qualifying stage?

    // DESCRIPTION:

// Let's imagine we have a popular online RPG. A player begins with a score of 
// 0 in class E5. A1 is the highest level a player can achieve.

// Now let's say the players wants to rank up to class E4. To do so the player 
// needs to achieve at least 100 points to enter the qualifying stage.

// Write a script that will check to see if the player has achieved at least 
// 100 points in his class. If so, he enters the qualifying stage.

// In that case, we return, "Well done! You have advanced to the qualifying 
// stage. Win 2 out of your next 3 games to rank up.".

// Otherwise return, False/false (according to the language in use).

//     // ***STARTER CODE***

//  function playerRankUp (points) {

// }   

//     //   ******TEST CASES*****
    
// const {assert} = require('chai')

// describe("Tests", () => {
//   it("test", () => {
//     assert.strictEqual(playerRankUp(64), false)
//     assert.strictEqual(playerRankUp(101), "Well done! You have advanced to the qualifying stage. Win 2 out of your next 3 games to rank up.")
//   });
// });

    // ******MY ANSWER********

function playerRankUp (p) {
return p<100?false:`Well done! You have advanced to the qualifying stage. Win 2 out of your next 3 games to rank up.`
  
}
